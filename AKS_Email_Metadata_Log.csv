Re: 737 Locust Grove Visit,"You’re welcome and Tuesday at 4 does work. But, as I told Andrew, I’ve given AKS all of my money plus some that I shouldn’t have touched If this doesn’t work out I’m planning on selling it for whatever it brings and get back on track financially.

Before we can agree on anything specific, we would like to schedule a time to visit the property to inspect what work was done and what still needs to be done. Does Tuesday at 4pm work? After inspecting the property, we will work up a new quote to review with you so you can see the cost it will take for us to finish the home, as well as a brand-new contract. We appreciate you reaching out and are hopeful we can resolve this matter. Please let us know if that day/time works for you. We look forward to hearing from you. Thanks!

Appliances,"The appliance links I sent are just suggestions. Martin’s might have some others they recommend. A 30” range and hood insert and a 30” fridge would work best in the space. I’ve had very good results with the Zephyr hood inserts. Vent-a-hood is another good brand for the hood insert. We could conceivably go with a little bit wider fridge, but staying to a 30 inch model for both the range and the fridge would definitely work best if at all possible. Feel free to give me a call when you’re at Martin’s if you feel that would be helpful. Thanks and happy shopping!

Front Porch,"Let me know what you think of the attached design for porch roof. We can also do an A-Frame roof, it would have a very low pitch. The floor will be brick stamp concrete, vinyl post wraps and railing. Maybe some nice built in wooden benches with a dark stain? I recommend the standing seam roofing for the porch, shingles do not hold up well on a roof with that low pitch. Do you want the same roofing on the garage as the rest of the house or standing seam metal? Also attached is the garage design. I did not figure an attic in the garage so the dormer and upper gable windows are non-functioning. Let me know if you want to make any changes to that.

I think the worst of the rain is over, looks like some sunshine towards the end of the week. Other than that everything has been going well, we are started with the new interior framing, siding crew has about half of their scaffolding up, chimney stucco crew started yesterday, I doubt they will be back until Friday due to weather. I have another truck load of stone coming tomorrow, the load they bought yesterday did about half the driveway. Met with the plumber yesterday, he will be doing the bathroom layouts for us, I will send to you for review or we can discuss on Sunday if he has them to us by then.

Re: Fw: Kitchen Layout,"Thanks Ed I forwarded this to Andrew but see that u included him in this email:) I’m going to an Appliance store in Gordonville & thinking of getting Thermador?

I did pick out the deep double sink that I have & it’s on site. I’m getting a Bosch dishwasher. Since I don’t have a deadline to move, YAY, it takes the burden off of timing. Do you want to paint them the same color as I have here? Moving into a white and black home is a little different. I do have a white kitchen in BB & dark granite & love that look. I’d love ur opinion! So, I have a lot to do and planning on getting it done asap😊 Please don’t hesitate to call or text, I’m more flexible now and thanks for ur input on the wood flooring!

Re: Fw: Kitchen Layout,"Good morning! I was at the site yesterday and just had a few questions: Do you have the casing width? I assume a 1/4” nominal reveal. Also assuming you’ll be using the same casing throughout. Will the opening to the hall left of the fridge be trimmed with casing? The pass through to the dining room height dimension should be lowered a bit so that the countertop can extend through the opening.

That opening will have French doors The pass through to the dining room height dimension should be lowered a bit so that the countertop can extend through the opening. The finish height to the top of the counter should be 36” above the finished floor. I assume the counter will be 3cm thick, but it would be good to have certainty on the top thickness before modifying. Agreed, that was an oversight on my part. Has the countertop fabricator been booked yet? No, do you have someone you recommend, i will be getting some pricing but open to suggestions. Do you have a tentative date for drywall on the calendar yet? Yes, tentatively the week of July 29. I need a list of appliances as soon as that’s been finalized. I assume the vent hood will not be ducted to outside? ________________________________ From: Artz Cabinets <artzcabinets@gmail.com <mailto:artzcabinets@gmail.com> > Sent: Monday, July 8, 2024 9:19 PM To: lastrasburg@aol.com <mailto:lastrasburg@aol.com> <lastrasburg@aol.com <mailto:lastrasburg@aol.com> > Cc: ANDREW STOLTZFUS <aksbuilders@outlook.com <mailto:aksbuilders@outlook.com> > Subject: Re: Fw: Kitchen Layout Hi Linda: I’m partial to Wolf SubZero, but recently we had trouble ",Artz Cabinets,artzcabinets@gmail.com,SMTP,ANDREW STOLTZFUS,aksbuilders@outlook.com,SMTP,lastrasburg@aol.com,lastrasburg@aol.com,SMTP,,,,,,Normal,,,artzcabinets@gmail.com,aksbuilders@outlook.com,andrew
Re: Latches-Interior Doors,"Good morning Yes, would love bronze oiled throughout in and out. I think a keypad. Not quite sure what u mean by panel layout?

Latches-Interior Doors,"Good afternoon, hope you are both doing well! Do you have a preference for front door latches, I know we discussed oil rubbed bronze for color. Do you want one with a keypad or do you prefer keyed entry? Also, style for interior doors and any specialty doors. Most important is panel layout and any special ones you want with glass in them. Some other things are countertops, tile and light fixtures. We are hanging drywall today and tomorrow. Hoping to have that all finished by the end of next week! Thanks!
